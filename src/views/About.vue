    h1 Who are we?

    p Kinema is an independent cinema based in Neukölln. We are very small (only one room, of around 50 seats), and we have a little cafe-bar (non-smoking, of course). We display not so recent movies, but certainly good. You can find here Kusturica, Wong Kar Wai or Spike Jonze film series.

    p How much? Our price is 5€ per movie.

    p Do you want a member card? It costs only 5€ to open it, and then you can just charge it on the go. 10 film sessions costs 40€, (4€ the movie). When you have attended 10, we invite you to one session! Great, now is time to enjoy the seventh art.
